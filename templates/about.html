                Welcome to our sleep disorder detection project, an experimental endeavor designed for educational
                purposes. It's important to note that while this project aims to raise awareness and understanding of
                sleep disorders, it is not a substitute for professional medical advice. The data utilized in this
                project is limited in size, and therefore, the accuracy and reliability may not match the standards of
                medical diagnosis.

                If you are experiencing any symptoms of insomnia or apnea, it is strongly advised to seek consultation
                with a qualified healthcare professional. Sleep disorders can be complex, and an accurate diagnosis
                requires a thorough examination by a medical expert. This project is intended to complement existing
                knowledge and promote awareness but should not be used as a standalone tool for medical decisions.

                We emphasize the significance of consulting with a doctor to address any concerns related to your sleep
                patterns or health. Timely and accurate medical guidance is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of
                your individual situation and the appropriate course of action.

                Remember, your health is of utmost importance, and seeking professional medical advice is the best
                approach for addressing any potential sleep-related issues.
